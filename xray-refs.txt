The custom field IDs can be obtained using the Jira REST API Browser tool included in Jira. Each ID is of the form "customfield_ID".
Another option, which does not require Jira administration rights, is to invoke the "Get edit issue meta" in an existing issue (e.g., in a Test issue) as mentioned here.
Example: GET http://yourserver/rest/api/2/issue/CALC-1/editmeta 
Example: GET https://beyondtrust.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/CALC-1/editmeta  (Doesn't work)

Potentiall useful demo of how to use the API:
